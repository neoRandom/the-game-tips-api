One of them is to go to the unwanted equipment and destroy it by clicking on the left stick. The most advantageous option is to visit a shop in Hogsmeade and sell any surplus equipment, as gold is extremely useful in Hogwarts Legacy. However, for times when players are away and cannot quickly return to Hogsmeade to unload their items, destroying the items will be the way to go."
